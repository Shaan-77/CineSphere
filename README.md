üçø CineSphere ‚Äì Frontend Movie Showcase Using React

Movie Explorer is a static, frontend-focused movie website built using React. Developed as part of my learning journey, this project was designed to improve my understanding of modern frontend development practices, including component-based architecture, responsive UI design, and client-side routing.

The application showcases a list of movies with their titles, posters, and basic details, all presented in a clean and interactive layout. Navigation between pages is handled using React Router, allowing for a smooth and seamless user experience across different views such as the home page, movie details, and category-specific listings.

While it does not include backend integration or dynamic data fetching, this project effectively demonstrates key frontend concepts and serves as a portfolio piece to showcase my skills in building responsive, single-page applications with React.
